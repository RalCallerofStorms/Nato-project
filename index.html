    <p>NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is a military and political alliance established in 1949 to ensure the collective defense of its member countries. 
        Headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, it currently includes 32 member nations from North America and Europe. The core principle of NATO is collective security, meaning that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all.
        This was famously invoked after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Originally formed to counter the Soviet threat during the Cold War, NATO now addresses a wide range of security challenges, including terrorism, cyber threats, and global instability, through joint military exercises, strategic planning, and international cooperation.
